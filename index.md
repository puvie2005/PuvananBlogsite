## Hello Everyone!!

![](docs/images/week01/assignment-photo.jpg){: width="50%"}

## Welcome to my EP1000 DigFab Website :)

This is the first website I have created prior to learning website development in EP1000.

## More about this website...

Here you can find out more about myself and my project. In this website, I'm going to document my Digital Fabrication and Prototyping project journey. This includes all the learning of various skills that I will equip myself in this semester.

In this semester of AY2021/2022, for EP1000, I will be learning how to document my project through the means of website such as HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I will also be equipped with hands-on knowledge such as 3D printing and Laser cutting of wood and other materials.

Please head onto the navigation bar to learn more about my EP1000 journey. I will update the website after each class to document my journey!

## Why did I choose Markdown?
I used the web-pk Jekyll template( EP100 ). I will list down my reasons for choosing Markdown over HTML/CSS below.


|                      Why Markdown?                    |                 Why not HTML/CS                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Design and layout is very clean and simple            | Editing mistakes is not as easy as markdown           |
| Easy to read and type out website is simplified       | Markdown template looks more professional than CSS    |
| Saves alot of time as it converts to HTML quickly     | Prefer the flow and writing of markdown than HTML     |


> However, I completed the HTML/CSS tasks and created my very own website. Do check it out at the link below!

## How did I create my HTML/CSS website?

### Template for pages HTML

Following picture was roughly the template used to create the HTML layout. It includes header, title, navigation and other features.
This template can be used for other pages like mine. I have used this to create my about page and projects page.

### Navigation bar
The sidebar was created using the lists function in HTML. The bar is sectioned using the <div> function.
The links that guide to the appropriate sites are enabled via <a href> function.

### CSS formatting
A style.css file had to be created to provide the html site with a layout. This template is referenced from [Jake Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE/).
The page is broken up into different portions. Each portion has are divided and given spaces using padding and margin aligning.
