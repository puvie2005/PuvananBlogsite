## Hello Everyone!!

![](docs/images/week01/assignment-photo.jpg){: width="50%"}

## Welcome to my EP1000 DigFab Website :)

This is the first website I have created prior to learning website development in EP1000.

## More about this website...

Here you can find out more about myself and my project. In this website, I'm going to document my Digital Fabrication and Prototyping project journey. This includes all the learning of various skills that I will equip myself in this semester.

In this semester of AY2021/2022, for EP1000, I will be learning how to document my project through the means of website such as HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I will also be equipped with hands-on knowledge such as 3D printing and Laser cutting of wood and other materials.

Please head onto the navigation bar to learn more about my EP1000 journey. I will update the website after each class to document my journey!
