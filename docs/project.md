# Final Project

After almost 2 terms of learning various skills ranginf from lasercutting to embedded programming, we were tasked to take on a final project. In this final project, we are to integrate 3D printing, CAD software skills and lasercutting with electronics to create a simple project. This project requires a certain level of planning and fabrication too. We are only given 3 weeks thus I went on for a simple idea. Read to find out more about my final project!

## My Sisyphean Machine

### What does it mean?
Well the word Sysiphean is just a synonym for the word useless.I chose this because I'm going to be making a useless machine! More importantly, it relates to a task not being completed.

### What does it do?
As mentioned earlier on, I will be making a useless machine. The machine comes with a switch for the user to toggle with. However, when the user turns on/ flicks the switch, an arm within the box will pop up and will flick the switch to its original position. The machines’ main purpose is to make the user’s input futile.

### What are it's features?
The Sisyphean machine uses a servo to open the lid and turn off the switch using an arm. The machine also has certain randomized behaviors to make it interesting. It behaves by turning off the switch with emotions like anger and curiosity. This is enabled by programming a randomized movement on Arduino.

### What will I make?
