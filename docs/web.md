# Web Development

I was taught how to create websites using **HTML/CSS** or **Markdown**. However, I chose to use markdown using Mr Steven's template from Github.

## Why did I choose Markdown?
I used the web-pk Jekyll template( EP100 ). I will list down my reasons for choosing Markdown over HTML/CSS below.


|                      Why Markdown?                    |                 Why not HTML/CS                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Design and layout is very clean and simple            | Editing mistakes is not as easy as markdown           |
| Easy to read and type out website is simplified       |     Markdown template looks more professional than CSS    |
| Saves alot of time as it converts to HTML quickly     |    Prefer the flow and writing of markdown than HTML     |
