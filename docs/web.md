# Web Development

I was taught how to create websites using **HTML/CSS** or **Markdown**. However, I chose to use markdown using Mr Steven's template from Github.

## Why did I choose Markdown?
I used the web-pk Jekyll template( EP100 ). I will list down my reasons for choosing Markdown over HTML/CSS below.


|                      Why Markdown?                    |                 Why not HTML/CS                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Design and layout is very clean and simple            | Editing mistakes is not as easy as markdown           |
| Easy to read and type out website is simplified       | Markdown template looks more professional than CSS    |
| Saves alot of time as it converts to HTML quickly     | Prefer the flow and writing of markdown than HTML     |

## How did I create my HTML/CSS website?

### Template for pages HTML

Following picture was roughly the template used to create the HTML layout. It includes header, title, navigation and other features.
This template can be used for other pages like mine. I have used this to create my about page and projects page.

### Navigation bar
The sidebar was created using the lists function in HTML. The bar is sectioned using the <div> function.
The links that guide to the appropriate sites are enabled via <a href> function.

### CSS formatting
A style.css file had to be created to provide the html site with a layout. This template is referenced from [Jake Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE/).
The page is broken up into different portions. Each portion has are divided and given spaces using padding and margin aligning.
