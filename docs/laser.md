* Once you have imported your 2D drawing to CorelDraw, shift select the drawing and press ctrl+g.
* Change the colour of the 2D model to red. For our settings, we used red to cut with preset speed and power. Use in accordance to your laser cutter
* Move it to a point to cut on the wooden board.
* Add text of your choice and position it. Make sure it is black( for Fablab laser cutters)
* Click pointer and select the starting point of the image. Click go to pointer and now you can start laser cutting.
