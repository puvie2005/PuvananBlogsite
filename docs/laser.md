* A laser cutting test had to be done prior to the music box assessment.
* We were tasked to produce a 2d keychain design, modify via CorelDraw and print it using the laser cutter.

### How do I go about laser cutting?

* Once you have imported your 2D drawing to CorelDraw, shift select the drawing and press ctrl+g.
* Change the colour of the 2D model to red. For our settings, we used red to cut with preset speed and power. Use in accordance to your laser cutter
* Move it to a point to cut on the wooden board.
* Add text of your choice and position it. Make sure it is black( for Fablab laser cutters)
* Click pointer and select the starting point of the image. Click go to pointer and now you can start laser cutting.


## Music box
To put our lasercutting and CAD skills to the test, we were tasked to design a simple music box and lasercut it. This section will be split into parts. Firstly the **CAD** portion and there on we will look into the **Lasercut** portion.
