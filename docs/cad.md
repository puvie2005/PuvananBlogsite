# Computer Aided Design
Notes on CAD

## Assignment

### Raster
One of the assignments for EP1000 is to learn and use raster graphics using a software called [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). We were tasked to remove the background of our selfie image and replace it with a seaside background of our choice. Most importantly, the image had to be resized to 1024 pixels wide.

#### What is raster?
In short it deals with pixels on the screen. It is usually used for photographs, images. Some formats that raster exists in; .bmp,.jpg,.png

### How to edit background?
1. Launch GIMP and head onto File > Open > select selfie image.
2. Now we want to make add a transparent layer to later add our seaside image. So go to Layer > Transparency > Add alpha channel
3. In order to seperate your selfie from the background, click the third tool on the toolbox on the top left.
4. Start clicking and tracing out the image. When it comes to the final point, select on the original point and click ENTER.
