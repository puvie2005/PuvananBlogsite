# FabLab Safety

## Introduction to safety

## Safety Quiz
A compulsory safety quiz had to be passed prior to our EP1000 lessons and Fablab sessions. It can be accessed via Blackboard. My Community> Fablab> Fablab quiz

## Passing requirements
-  Minimum of 90/100 had to be scored within 5 tries to pass the quiz.
-  However, some troubles were faced whereby the quiz glitched and maxed out the 5 tries. It was resolved by Mr Rodney who reset the 5 tries.
