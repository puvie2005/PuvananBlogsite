# Project Management

## I already have a html site, now what?
Once you have done with the html, you would realise you dont really have a website link and its harder to manage and keep track of your site. So, in this page we will learn how to publish our site, update it, keep track of the site and also backtrack when needed.
## What do I need to achieve this?
1. [GITHUB Desktop app](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
2. [Github website](https://github.com/).

### Let's start!
1. Firstly sign in or sign up for a github account.
2. Now let's create a new repository. Name it as your website or your project name!
